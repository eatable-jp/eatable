# Eatable

SAVE MONEY AND THE EARTH WITH EATABLE.\
Eatable is an app for selling food that is close to its expiration date for the discounted price.

## Introduction

This app was created during the team's time as students at [Code Chrysalis](https://www.codechrysalis.io/).

Did you know there is about 6 million tons of food waste every year in Japan?\
This is quite a shocking number and after we learned this we immediately started brainstorming about how we could have an impact on this situation and thatâ€™s where the idea of Eatable came from.

## Main features

Here is a brief description of the core features of Eatable.

### Features for sellers

1. **Full CRUD operation on listed items**
   A seller can list a new item on Eatable. They can also update information of each item and delete items after listing.
2. **Activity stats**
   A seller can check out their activity stats on the profile page. We provide the stats for the amount of food and money a seller saved through Eatable.

### Features for buyers

1. **Variety of filters**
   A buyer can filter listed items with different criteria such as food type, expiration date and location.
2. **Online payment with stripe**
   A buyer can make a payment through Eatable so that they can simply visit the shop and pick up the purchased item
